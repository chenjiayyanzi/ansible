ansible config file can be in the following directory:
./ansible.cfg
~/.ansible.cfg
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

#if you set ansible config file by env variable:
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/username/ansible.cfg
#the default config file will this one

#run command to see
ansible --version

basically, the search path is: ANSIBLE_CONFIG --> ./ansible.cfg --> ~/.ansible.cfg  --> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

host file: for all the machine to control
[all]
hostname1
hostname2
...

Here we are using Vagrant to create three VM(app1,app2,db), so we need to config hosts file like this:
192.168.60.4 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

then add you id_ras.pub publickey into the VM machine 
vagrant ssh app1
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#add your publickey 
#another way is using ssh-copy-id hostname 

then we can connect to VMs using ansible:
ansible all -m ping
