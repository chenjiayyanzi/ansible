#using roles: load related var files, tasks, handlers
#and other ansible artifacts based on a known file structure.
#Once you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse
#them and share them with other users.

#create file structure:
ansible-galaxy init nginx

#create the main playbook in the same level of nginx role directory
# include the role
cat nginx_playbook.yml
---
- hosts: all
  
  roles:
    - nginx

...

#after adding all the contents to the files in roles directory,
#for example, vars, tasks and handlers etc. you can start to run
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yml
