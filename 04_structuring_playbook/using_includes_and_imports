#using includes and imports
all import are static
include: maybe static, maybe dynamic, deponding on the version of ansible

- import_tasks
- import_playbook

- include_tasks: dynamic
- include_vars: dynamic

other considerations:
include_*: dynamic, can be used with loops
import_*: static, Cannot be used with loops
