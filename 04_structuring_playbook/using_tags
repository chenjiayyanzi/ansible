#using tags
you can run only specific parts of a large playbook with ansible tags


#example 1: tag to individual tasks
#for example, if you have a few tasks with the same tag "ntp", you can run these
#tasks in a playbook with --tags ntp.
tasks:
  - name: Install ntp
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: ntp
      state: present
    tags: ntp

  - name: Configure ntp
    ansible.builtin.template
      src: ntp.conf.j2
      dest: /etc/ntp.conf
    notify:
    - restart ntpd
    tags: ntp

  - name: Enable and run ntpd
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: ntpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes
    tags: ntp

  - name: Install NFS utils
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: 
      - nfs-utils
      - nfs-util-lib
      state: present
    tags: filesharing


#example 2: adding tags to playbook
---
- hosts: all
  tags:
    - nginx

  tasks: 
    - name: Install EPEL
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        update_cache: yes
        state: present
      when ansible_distribution == 'Centos'
      tags:
        - install-epel

    - name: 

...
#you can run the playbook with tags
#ansbile-playbook nginx_playbook.yml --tags nginx

#special tags: always and never
- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  notify: check http service
  tags:
    - always

# no matter which tags you will run, the tasks with tags alawys will run for sure
